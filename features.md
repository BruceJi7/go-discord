# Features for this bot

This bot is going to be modelled on FCC Bot.
The first real bot I'll make with Go will be that, a replacement FCC Bot.

With that said, it should have some particular features:

### Target Features

- Erase messages (admin)
- Respond to reactions and assign or remove roles

#### Other Features

### Stretch Features
